This repository hosts the bibliography of the radical group.  This is maintained like this:

  - git clone git@github.com:saga-project/radical.wp.git
    # you should have write permissions now
  - cd radical.wp/publications/
  - vi radical_rutgers.bib
    # yes, use vi.  No, Emacs won't work ;-)
    # Just kidding...

In that bibfile, add bib entries in the correct format and
order.  Format:  use 'bookchapter' entries for book
chapters, 'article' entries for journal publications,
'inproceedings' for conference papers, etc.  Please keep
formatting clean, and add only keys which make sense.
Please adhere to the same author naming style everwhere
('Albert Einstein and Paris Hilton and Jesus Christ' for
example).

Note that the comments in the bib file are significant: 
  - '## ...' lines define subsections for the radical 
    publications page,
  - '# ....' define years, and 
  - all bib entries after '## END' are ignored.  
Please don't change that formatting w/o due consideration,
and please keep ordering intact.

Finally, please add the pdf URLs to the respective entries,
as 'url = {...},' line.  You'll see similar lines for other
entries.  Please make sure you follow the formatting of
other entries, and don't change their order (unless
something needs fixing of course).  

Once you have done that, you can run:

  - make

which basically runs 

	- rm -f bib/*
	- ./bib2wp.pl radical_rutgers.bib radical_rutgers.wp radical_rutgers_drafts.wp
	- git add radical_rutgers*.wp bib2wp.pl pdf/ bib/

The perl command may need the BibTex::Parser perl module - let me know
if that is missing on your system, and you need help installing it...

That program does a couple of things:

  - creates radical_rutgers.wp (see below)
  - creates a number of bibtex snippets in bib/*.bib
  - fetches all PDF links it finds in the bibtex, and stores them in pdf/

So, you should see a couple of PDF downloads for those links you
added. Please check if those downloads complete successfully, and fix
the URLs as needed.  Also, after the run, please make sure that the
stored files are indeed PDFs, like:

  merzky@thinkie:~/saga/radical.wp/publications/pdf (master) $ file *
  2012arXiv1207.6644L.pdf: PDF document, version 1.5
  async_repex11.pdf:       PDF document, version 1.4
  ...
  saga_europar10.pdf:      PDF document, version 1.4
  sagastuff.pdf:           PDF document, version 1.4

Once that is done, please commit everything to git:

  - git add radical_rutgers.bib radical_rutgers*.wp bib/* pdf/*
  - git commit -m 'update bib with PDF urls, fetch pdfs, perl is great'
  - git push

Also, the contents of radical_rutgers.wp need to be cut/pasted into
the wordpress editor for the publications page (HTML version), and 
similar for the drafts page..
