This is an ADDON plugin to give further functionality to the plugin [Simple 301 Redirects](http://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-301-redirects/) plugin.

[Simple 301 Redirects - Addon - Bulk Uploader](http://kingpro.me/plugins/support-plugins/simple-301-redirects-addon-bulk-uploader/) adds an extra section to the settings tab
to upload a CSV of old and new URL's to input into the Simple 301 Redirects plugin. An example CSV is bundled in with the plugin to get you going quickly.

The plugin checks for duplicate old URLs and alerts you of these in the summary after your CSV has been processed.
